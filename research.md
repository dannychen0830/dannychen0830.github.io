## Research

> "It has always been a temptation for mathematicians to present the crystallized product of their thoughts as a deductive general theory and to relegate the individual mathematical phenomenon into the role of an example. The reader who submits to the dogmatic form will be easily indoctrinated. Enlightenment, however, must come from an understanding of motives; live mathematical development springs from specific natural problems which can be easily understood, but whose solutions are difficult and demand new methods of more general significance."

I'm interested in probability theory and networks, bridging together structure, dynamics, and information. More broadly speaking, I would like to solve interesting and difficult problems in engineering and science while providing principled mathematical justifications. 

Current projects include: 
- long-time behavior and sensitivity of queueing networks
- communication properties of biological signal transduction systems
- universal phenomena of high-dimensional projections
