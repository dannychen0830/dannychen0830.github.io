## Research

My interest broadly lies in dynamical and statistical properties of stochastic systems, natural and engineering systems alike. Here are a few examples:

- information processing in cells
- quantum circuit cutting and fragment reconstruction
- training dynamics in deep neural networks
- theory and application of Markov chain monte carlo 

More often then not, we use randomness because we have to (we, from our selfish perspectives, live in an imperfect world afterall). Every experiment comes with an unenumerable list of confounding factors, and probability provides a language for being "hand-wavy" towards these external influences while productively drawing conclusions. However, through recent years, we've found many examples in natural world and engineering choices where stochasticity is intrinsic and/or beneficial! 

For the specifics, perhaps looking at [what I am reading/want to read](./reading_list.html) would help.
