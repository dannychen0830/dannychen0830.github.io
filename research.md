## Research

My interest broadly lies in dynamical and statistical properties of stochastic systems, natural and engineering systems alike. I also want to learn more how control, information, and thermodynamics can be used to study random processes. 

Here are a few examples of what I would like to know more about:
- biology: information processing in cells, population dynamics and ecology
- operations research: game theory, queueing theory
- others: training dynamics of artificial neural networks, MCMC

For some concrete examples on the things I have done, in addition to original results in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W72N33YAAAAJ&hl=en), the [notes page](./notes.html) will show you a few things I know and the [reading list page](./reading_list.html) will tell you where I'm heading next.
