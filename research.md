## Research

> We have not succeeded in answering all our problems. The answers we have found only serve to raise a whole set of new questions. In some ways we feel we are as confused as ever, but we believe we are confused on a higher level and about more important things.

My interest broadly lies in dynamical and statistical properties of stochastic systems, natural and engineering systems alike. Here are a few examples:

- information processing in cells
- quantum circuit cutting and fragment reconstruction
- applications of Markov chains (both discrete and continuous!) 

More often then not, we use randomness because we have to (we, from our selfish perspectives, live in an imperfect world afterall). Every experiment comes with an unenumerable list of confounding factors, and probability provides a language for being "hand-wavy" towards these external influences while productively drawing conclusions. However, through recent years, we've found many examples in natural world and engineering choices where stochasticity is intrinsic and/or beneficial! 

For some concrete examples, in addition to original results in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=W72N33YAAAAJ&hl=en), the [notes page](./notes.html) will show you a few things I know and the [reading list page](./reading_list.html) will tell you where I'm heading next.
