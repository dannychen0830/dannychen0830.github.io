I am genericallly interested in probability theory.
My PhD work focuses on developing limit theories for stochastic dynamics on networks, the goal being to understand how microscopic structues induce complex, global phenomena.
For me, the value of mathematics lies in providing a framework for precisely describing the world we see and I am excited to establish mathematical foundations for machine learning, biology, economics, and quantum sciences.
