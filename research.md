## Research

As mentioned before, my interest lies in stochastic things; stochastic processes and probabilistic algorithms are two of my current favorite. More specifically, I'm interested in studying algorithms in classical and (occasionally) quantum computers as well as a variety of biological systems (particularly neural systems). And hopefully, probability theory can offer invaluble insights for it.
