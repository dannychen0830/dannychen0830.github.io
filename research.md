## Research

My interest broadly lies in stochastic dynamics observed in natural and engineering systems alike. I also would love to explore its intersection with control, large deviation, and information theory.

Here are a few examples of what I am working on/would like to know more about:
- information processing in cells
- control and games of networked agents
- training dynamics of artificial neural networks

I've also worked on several quantum computing projects in my undergraduate years. Notably, there are a few works on quantum circuit cutting and one work on quantum networks.

For some concrete examples on the things I have done, in addition to original results in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=si6Phg8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&authuser=2&sortby=pubdate), the [notes page](./notes.html) will show you a few things I know and the [reading list page](./reading_list.html) will tell you where I'm heading next.
