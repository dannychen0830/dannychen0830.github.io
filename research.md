## Research

> "It has always been a temptation for mathematicians to present the crystallized product of their thoughts as a deductive general theory and to relegate the individual mathematical phenomenon into the role of an example. 
The reader who submits to the dogmatic form will be easily indoctrinated. 
Enlightenment, however, must come from an understanding of motives; live mathematical development springs from specific natural problems which can be easily understood, but whose solutions are difficult and demand new methods of more general significance."

I am genericallly interested in probability theory.
My PhD work focuses on developing limit theories for stochastic dynamics on networks, the goal being to understand how microscopic structues induce complex, global phenomena.
For me, the value of mathematics lies in providing a framework for precisely describing the world we see and I am excited to establish mathematical foundations for machine learning, biology, economics, and quantum sciences.
