I'm Danny:

- computer scientist in the day
- applied mathematician at night
- (aspiring) physicist at heart

I recieved B.A. in Mathematics and B.A. Computer Science (yeah, a startling number of _two_ degrees :D ) at Case Western Reserve University. My research interest lies generally in stochastic processes and inference. More details are provided in my [research page](./research.html) or can be found on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=W72N33YAAAAJ).

If you happen to stumble on upon this website and wants to reach out to me about my research, notes, hobbies, grad school apps advice, I will be more than happy to connect with you. I'm easily reachable at **txc461@case.edu**.
