I'm current third year undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at Case Western Reserve University. I am curious on subjects related to probability and computation. Outside of academics, I am particularly involved in music (specifically jazz) and a big fan of cooking. Whenever I feel like I've been sitting on my chair for too long, I like to go bike or skateboard around the neighborhood, travelling in a somewhat random way. Also, I enjoy writing on anything that's not the stack of blank paper in front of me (the windows in the living room, the piece of glass separating the shower and the toilet, etc). 

I'm now heavily considering applying for graduate school (Ph.D programs) this semester! If you happen to stumble on upon this website and is willing to offer advice for that, I will be more than happy to connect with you. I'm easily reachable at **txc461@case.edu** (in fact, I'm better at replying emails than text or any other form of messages).

This is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=W72N33YAAAAJ) if you're interested in my research (hopefully, many to come), or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/txc461/) if you want a more professional introduction of me.
