I'm Danny:

I am a PhD student in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown university studying under Professor [Kavita Ramanan](https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics/faculty/kavita-ramanan/home). 
My research interest lies generally in applied probability. 
More details are provided in my [research page](./research.html).
