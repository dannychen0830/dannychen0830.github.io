I'm current second year undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at Case Western Reserve University. Academically, my interest lies in stochastic things; stochastic processes and probabilistic algorithms are two of my current favorite. More specifically, I'm interested in studying algorithms in classical and (occasionally) quantum computers as well as a variety of biological systems (particularly neural systems). And hopefully, probability theory can offer invaluble insights for it. 

I'm now heavily considering applying for graduate school (Ph.D programs) next semester! If you happen to stumble on upon this website and is willing to offer advice for that, I will be more than happy to [connect with you](./contact.html).

This is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=W72N33YAAAAJ) if you're interested in my research (hopefully, many to come).
