I'm current second year undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science at Case Western Reserve University. I am curious on subjects related to probability and computation. Outside of academics, I am particularly involved in music (specifically jazz). And whenever I sit on my chair for too long, my current preference is to go biking around the neighborhood, travelling in a somewhat random way. Also, I enjoy writing on anything that's not the stack of blank paper in front of me (so, the windows in the living room, the piece of glass next to the toilet, ...). 

I'm now heavily considering applying for graduate school (Ph.D programs) next semester! If you happen to stumble on upon this website and is willing to offer advice for that, I will be more than happy to [connect with you](./contact.html).

This is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=W72N33YAAAAJ) if you're interested in my research (hopefully, many to come).
