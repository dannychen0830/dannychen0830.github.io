I'm Danny:

- ~~computer scientist~~ applied mathematician in the day
- applied mathematician at night
- (aspiring) physicist at heart

I am now a PhD student in the division of applied mathematics at Brown university. Before that, I was a full-time software engineer at Northrop Grumman 2Is Solutions. I recieved my Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science from Case Western Reserve University. My research interest lies generally in applied stochastic analysis. More details are provided in my [research page](./research.html), and concrete results can be found on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=si6Phg8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&authuser=2&sortby=pubdate).


If you happen to stumble on upon this website and wants to reach out to me about research, notes, hobbies, grad school apps, I will be more than happy to connect with you. I'm easily reachable at **daniel_t_chen@brown.edu**.
