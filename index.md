I'm Danny:

- computer scientist in the day
- applied mathematician at night
- (aspiring) physicist at heart

I recieved my Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science from Case Western Reserve University. My research interest lies generally in applied stochastic analysis. More details are provided in my [research page](./research.html) or can be found on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=si6Phg8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&authuser=2&sortby=pubdate).


> I will be heading south to Providence for the next years for my PhD in applied math! I'll officially not be a computer scientist in the day, and (train to) become a full-time applied mathematician!

If you happen to stumble on upon this website and wants to reach out to me about research, notes, hobbies, grad school apps, I will be more than happy to connect with you. I'm easily reachable at **daniel_t_chen@brown.edu**.
