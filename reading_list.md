## Reading List

This will be my study plans for the future. This is an idea inspired by [Professor Cosma Shalizi](http://bactra.org/notebooks/) at CMU. I'll put some reading goals down and, if motivated enough, typeset it and store a summary in [notes](./notes.html).The first section is there to keep myself on track, and the second section archieves the potential readings.

### Readings for right now

- Amir, Ariel. "Thinking Probabilistically."
- Gardiner, Crispin. Stochastic methods. Vol. 4. Berlin: Springer, 2009.

### Readings Ideas for the near future

- Schilling, Ren√© L. Measures, integrals and martingales. Cambridge University Press, 2017.
