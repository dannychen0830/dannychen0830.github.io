## Reading List

This will be my study plans for the future. This is an idea inspired by [Professor Cosma Shalizi](http://bactra.org/notebooks/) at CMU. I'll put some reading goals down and, if motivated enough, typeset it and store a summary in [notes](./notes.html).The first section is there to keep myself on track, and the second section archieves the potential readings.

### Readings for right now

- Harris, Rosemary J., and Gunther M. Schütz. "Fluctuation theorems for stochastic dynamics." _Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment_ 2007, no. 07 (2007): P07020.

### Readings Ideas for the near future

- Çinlar, Erhan, and E. ðCınlar. _Probability and Stochastics_. Vol. 261. New York: Springer, 2011.
- Oksendal, Bernt. _Stochastic Differential Equations: An Introduction with Applications_. Springer Science & Business Media, 2013.
- Tu, Loring W. _An Introduction to Manifolds_. New York, N.Y: Springer, 2011.
