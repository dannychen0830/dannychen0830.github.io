## Story time!

Welcome to story time. I'll occasionally record funny/provocative/intriguing stories that I experienced or heard here. 


### The Spear and the Shield
> The word for "contradictory" in Mandarin is çŸ›ç›¾; the former character means spear, and the latter means shield. And the story goes as follow.
> 
> Way way back in time in the ancient streets of China, two salesmen were trying to sell their products. 
> 
> "Come buy my shield! It's the sturdiest shield in the world! No weapon can peirce through my shield!" One of the saleman exclaimed.
> 
> "Come buy my spear! It's the sharpest spear in the world! It can pierce through any object!" The other saleman yelled.
> 
> Then, a curious guy came along and asked, "Well, if you, sir, have the strongest spear and you, sir, have the strongest shield, then why don't you try stabbing the strongest shield with the strongest spear?" This is paradoxal because one of the saleman must be false. Hence, the word "spear-shield." 
> 
> This is quite an unsatisfactory ending, isn't it? So, who won? Did they try stabbing the shield with the spear? Or did they awkwardly walk away from the smart dude who pointed everything out the paradox? Maybe they even partnered with each other and sold the shield and spear as a set for 15 percent off? 
> 
> My dad resolved the story for me. The spear-selling man won, but not by showing that his spear can pentrate the strongest shield, but by stabbing the other saleman! The moral of the story is: if you can't beat you competitor through proper means, do it through an improper means! 


### Dr.Wiener's Lunch
> This is a story told by professor Peter Thomas in MATH 378 (Computational Neuroscience).
> 
> Professor Thomas's advisor, Jack Cowan, studied at MIT when Norbert Wiener, who invented the Wiener Process, was there. Apparently, Dr. Wiener would lecture with a  chalk in one hand and eraser in the other. While he wrote the theorems and proofs down on the board with one hand, he would erase what was written immediately with the other. Professor Thomas conjectured that this was some type of mechanism for finding those who are mathematically talented...
> 
> Also, there was once Dr. Cowan walked up to Dr.Wiener in the cafeteria as Dr. Wiener was about to leave. They talked for a bit. And upon ending the conversation, Dr. Wiener asked:
> 
> "Was I entering the cafeteria or was I about to leave?"
> 
> Dr.Cowan reminded him that he was leaving. Then, Dr.Wiener replied:
> 
> "Oh! In that case, I must have eaten," and left the cafeteria.
