## Jazz musicians that you should check out

Just as an FYI, this list will mostly be saxophone players as I am one myself. Also, I'll avoid putting those _really_ big names down, like Michael Brecker, Chris Potter, orJoshua Redman. You should know those guys for sure, but this list would be dedicated to the younger guys (younger as in older than me, still). Lastly, this is by no means an exhaustive list. It would be quite amazing if it is. 

1. [Michael Thomas](https://www.michaelthomasjazz.com/): I had the pleasure of studying with him for a combined two weeks at the NEC jazz lab years ago. He's a really nice guy, extremely knowledgeable, and plays fantanstic music. Most people (in musics, sports, etc) go through a period where they model their playing after someone they admire; I try to be like Michael Thomas in my alto playing even to this day.
2. [Melissa Aldana](https://www.melissaaldana.net/): She's my current "tenor hero". She's just... so good! She plays some of the most creative lines (for an example, check out the recording of [her playing the standard _Without a Song_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXN-tnWx1A)). 
3. [Lucas Pino](https://www.lucaspino.com/): His (and Tony Lustig's) rendition of [_Lines for Lyons_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCkmse__Rjg) inspired me to pick up a tenor saxophone. I would vote him as the tenor player with the best sound any day (yes, in the history of mankind).

There's more to come, but I better get to work...
