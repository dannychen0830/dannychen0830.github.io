## My Music Page!

For those sharp-11 enthusiasts out there, welcome! Hopefully you wouldn't mind my naive effort in putting this page together. For those who can't handle as much spice, you're also welcomed. It's 

# Good musicians to check out

Just as an FYI, this list will mostly be comprised of saxophone players as I am one myself. 

1. [Michael Thomas](https://www.michaelthomasjazz.com/): I had the pleasure of studying with him for a combined two weeks at the NEC jazz lab years ago. He's a really nice guy, extremely knowledgeable, and plays fantanstic music. Most people (in musics, sports, etc) go through a period where they model their playing after someone they admire; I try to be like Michael Thomas in my alto playing even to this day.
2. [Melissa Aldana](https://www.melissaaldana.net/): She's my current "tenor hero". She's just... so good! She plays some of the most creative lines (for an example, check out the recording of [her playing the standard _Without a Song_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXN-tnWx1A)). 
3. [Lucas Pino](https://www.lucaspino.com/): His (and Tony Lustig's) rendition of [_Lines for Lyons_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCkmse__Rjg) inspired me to pick up a tenor saxophone. I would vote him as the tenor player with the best sound any day (yes, in the history of mankind).
4. [Maria Schneider](https://www.mariaschneider.com/): Got free tickets to her concert with the Cleveland Jazz Orchestra once and I was probably the best thing that happened that year. It was crazy how articulate she is without using words; her music transports to her world where you see what she sees, hear what she hears, and feel what she feels. ~~The only thing I don't admire about her is her view on AI...~~  

# Some of my compositions

Just like how I write stories, I try to write music if I have time. I have one composition titled *Yogurt* that is written sloppily, so I'm not posting that. Hopefully, there's one more to come.
