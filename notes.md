## Notes

Below are some notes that I typesetted for less formal presentations, e.g., in class or research group 
meetings.

_Caution_: there are certainly mistakes (typographical or otherwise). Feel free to contact me if you'd like to see them corrected :) 


### Graduate 

- This is a group meeting presentation I did on [diffusion models for generative modeling](./pdf/ddpm-2024.pdf).
- This is a subset of the topics covered in areading course (under Prof. Paul Dupuis) over the summer on [stochastic analysis](./pdf/sde-reading-2024.pdf). 
- Here's a set of (very incomplete) notes on [large deviations theory](./pdf/ldp-reading-2024.pdf). The reading course was made possible by the guidance of Prof. Paul Dupuis and companion of Will (Yaochen) Zhu. 

### Undergrad

- Here's the basics of [Markov Chain, Monte Carlo, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo](./pdf/MCMC.pdf). We covered Markov chain mixing, psuedorandomness, and two MCMC algorithms (Metropolis-Hastings and Glauber dynamics).
- There was a version of non-measure-theoretic stochastic processes in preparation, but there are just so much more to learn. To put something up for the sake of uploading, here's a (very) [incomplete version](./pdf/Notes_on_Stochastic_Processes.pdf) up.
