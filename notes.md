## Notes

I'll post my notes that I find worthy of typesetting neatly here. 

- Here's the basics of [Markov Chain, Monte Carlo, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo](./pdf/MCMC.pdf). We covered Markov chain mixing, psuedorandomness, and two MCMC algorithms (Metropolis-Hastings and Glauber dynamics).
- There was a version of non-measure-theoretic stochastic processes in preparation, but there are just so much more to learn. To put something up for the sake of uploading, here's a (very) [incomplete version](./pdf/Notes_on_Stochastic_Processes.pdf) up.

*** Update: Since I'll be taking a(n unplanned) gap year, I expect myself to be doing lots of learning. I decided to compile all my notes [in this Overleaf document](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rrwwgdgmrhhn) so that I don't have to keep updating Github.
