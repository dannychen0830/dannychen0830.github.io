## Notes

I'll post my notes that I find worthy of typesetting neatly here. There is one on stochastic processes in preparation. Hopefully, it can be done in 2 months.

Update: It's been (a lot) more than 2 months and it is not even close to being done. There are so much more to learn and I just keep adding things. I'll put my (very) [incomplete version](./pdf/Notes_on_Stochastic_Processes.pdf) up.
