## Things I have to be better at...

I've done way too many stupid things. Just 10 minutes ago, I realized I did something stupid again. I am currently so annoyed at myself that I cannot possibly focus on the paper that I have to read for tomorrow. So, I will write down my fatal flaws as a constant reminder for myself.

### 1. Be more careful
This problem has been with me since I was a kid. I got a lot more careful with things, especially in doing arithmetic, but I have to be more careful on other things. __Think a few steps ahead!__ I submitted a project for a course at the supposed deadline, expecting feedback from the professor. However, I never got the feedback (this will bring us to the second point). I should have sat down and just proof read the text again, not realizing that the version I initially submitted was _really_ rough. I should have 1) proof read it more carefully the first time even though it was meant to be a draft, and 2) proof read it carefully the second time knowing that I submitted a draft. Now, I just messed up on the final project of a course I cared about a lot. __Be more aware of the current circumstances__, and be more careful in dealing with it. Don't be lazy.

### 2. Don't be afraid to bother others
I didn't want to bother my dad to wake up early. It turned out that I set my alarm to the wrong time, and I ended up missing course registration. It could have been avoided if I followed #1 and if I was willing to take my dad's offer to be safe. Now, I'm at risk of not being able to graduate in time (in 3 yeras, that is) because of the missing courses. I didn't want to bother my professor to give me feedback because I know that he's really busy. __When things matter and it is reasonable to be asking for help, do it!__ Unless I know for a fact that #1 is being followed exactly, make the safe decision. On the other hand, if I don't want something, say no. 

### 3. Learn to ask questions
I don't know everything. In fact, I know barely anything. So, just ask! But aside from the dumb questions, learn to think critically, and ask good questions. In computational neuroscience, I was asked to do this a lot after reading articles and the textbook. I realized that I'm really bad at this. Try to __find what I don't know__. This is true for self-studying, too. Find what's unknown -- pin it down exactly -- and go find the answer rather than wondering around pointlessly.

OK... I feel much better now. Back to work!
