## My First Workshop -- Mathematical Models in Biology 

This is my first workshop titled [_Mathematical Models in Biology_](http://www.birs.ca/events/2022/5-day-workshops/22w5155) and I am more than happy to be invited by my two awesome professors: [Peter Thomas](https://case.edu/math/thomas/) and [Andrew Eckford](http://eckfordlab.org/index.php/Main_Page) to travel all the way to Banff. I've been to Canada once. It was at least 6 years ago and I visited the Niagra Falls for a day. I'd like to say that this is my first _real_ trip to Canada, and I'll be spending 5 days at Banff. I decided to document this trip as a student hanging out among the professors and as a clueless tourist. 

### Day 0 - the day of arrival 

I woke up at 7am to catch the flight. My car tires decided that they didn't like me two nights back, which means I have to spend the next day (the day before the trip) replacing the tires, in addition to packing all my stuff for this trip and later (going to Austin, TX) and getting my unnecessarily long hair trimmed. Thankfully that was all settled at the cost of a few green Benjamin Franklins. 

I was flying from Cleveland to Toronto. I suppose there's no a lot of Clevelanders leaving for Canada, so we got this tiny aircraft -- probably the smallest I've been on -- and was ready to fly. I'm pretty sure I passed out immediately after I sit down and stayed that way until we landed. I do get really bad motion sickness if I read (or eat chocolate chip cookies, oddly) in any vehicle, so there's not much I else I can do. The odd thing is: the person sitting next to me looks very, and I mean __very__ much like Professor Thomas, but I'm quite sure that it's not him. Oh well, I guess I'll have to ask him tomorrow when I see him. 

Canada gives a very relaxing vibe to me. It feels familiar because it's in English (though, you don't have checking accounts in Canada, you get a _Chequing_ account instead) (it's like Hamiltonians are not stochastic in quantum mechanics, they are _stoquastic_) (no wonder why Canadians are good at quantum information sciences), but it feels very different from any United States airport. Everything seems to be at a slower pace, which I really enjoyed. And don't get me wrong, the airport is very busy, but I don't feel rushed here. Perhaps it's just my Canadian stereotype kicking in, but I so far (as in the past 2 hours) am enjoying Canada a lot. 

I will be heading to Calgary in a couple of hours, then taking a bus from the airport to the Banff Center (or the Banff _Centre_ to be authentic). It will be at least 10pm Banff time when I settle down, which is 12pm Eastern time. I think at that point, I would be too exhausted to type, but I might upload a few pictures if there are nice views during the ride.

### Day 1 - the scary day 

First, an update on yesterday. I met a fresh MD PhD graduate yesterday at the Toronto airport. Just from the few minutes of talking, I can tell that he's extremely competent and collected. He reminds me of my roommate in last year, so I really enjoyed talking to him. After the 4 hour flight to Calgary, I had dinner at the 7-11 next to baggage claim. The food is standard. 7-11 hotdogs in the Northan American region will never match the  ones in Taiwan :( 

Today (or yestderday, as I was to tired to write this last night) was a fun day. I got to meet those I worked with on Zoom in-person! It was very odd knowing a person online for a whole year and finally knowing what the person is like. Zoom camera always distorts the person in some way. Out of all the talks, I liked [Oleg's](https://igoshin.rice.edu/) talk on thermodynamical trade-offs in kinetic proof reading and [Zhiyue's](https://chem.unc.edu/faculty/lu-zhiyue/) talk on biological sensing and its multiplexing complexity. Lastly, we went on a hike up Tunnel Mountain (see below). Spectacular views and the hike is not difficult. But I guess I was out of shape, that's why this entry is delayed!
