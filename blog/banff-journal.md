## My First Workshop -- Mathematical Models in Biology 

This is my first workshop titled [_Mathematical Models in Biology_](http://www.birs.ca/events/2022/5-day-workshops/22w5155) and I am more than happy to be invited by my two awesome professors: [Peter Thomas](https://case.edu/math/thomas/) and [Andrew Eckford](http://eckfordlab.org/index.php/Main_Page) to travel all the way to Banff. I've been to Canada once. It was at least 6 years ago and I visited the Niagra Falls for a day. I'd like to say that this is my first _real_ trip to Canada, and I'll be spending 5 days at Banff. I decided to document this trip as a student hanging out among the professors and as a clueless tourist.
