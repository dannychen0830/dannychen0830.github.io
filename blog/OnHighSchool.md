## On High School

Just today, I was listening to a few of those _high school/college freshmen advice_ videos on Youtube while Latexing my statistics homework. Having people talking in the background ~~instead of the sound of cranes fighting~~ somehow made me more productive in typing down my solutions already written on a sheet of paper. They advocated for a few things generally:

1. Start your college application early. They are extremely time consuming. 
2. Challenge yourself academically. Take APs.
3. Do more extracurriculars. Find something that your passionate about.
4. Don't waste your summer doing nothing. 
5. Do your research! Make a college list where you'll be happy regardless of which school you get into. 

I agree with a lot of those. If any high school/college people stumble their way here, I'll say (from the life experiences that I do have right now), these sounds like solid advice and by all means, do it... There are more subtleties though.

### Point 1
There's actually nothing to argue here. Start thinking about your personal statement early. Try writing a few. I wrote a few renditions of personal statements. Some were __very__ bad, but there's no harm in that. It would only serve as a pleasure to re-read in the future. (Unless you're like me, who didn't save my Google Drive locally and lost everything once the school account was deleted... _sigh_) If you're a bad writer like me, then you kind of have to accept that you can't really accurate describe what you said. So, start to get into the habit of reading more books ~~(I totally did this)~~ because the more you read, the more you're accustomed to the process of formulating natural languages, and the better of a writer you will be.

### Point 2
Challenge yourself is good, but __make sure you know what you're doing__. Here's my own story:

> I hated math ever since my first introduction of it. I don't like it, and I'm bad at it. In the first three years of high school, I was very much a biology person. In fact, when I entered the Science bowl in my senior year, I was the biology person (that is, the person responsible for answering biology questions). However, since I grew up in Taiwan, I naturally had a bit more math training than most Americans at the same age. So, in my Junior year, I was taking AP Calculus BC like my fellow Asian friends, even though I didn't like it.
> 
> But after a series of ~~undramatic~~ events, I became interested in math. I did fine in the Calc III class offered in my high school, but soon, I realized that I have a very weak foundation in Calculus stuff. One good thing about my BC teacher was that he actually went about proving everything (well, I don't think he did all the delta-epsilon stuff, but he did everything, I guess, mediocrely detailed), which means _theroetically_ I should be quite good at Calculus. In reality, I feel like I passed BC Calc just now -- after taking undergrad real analysis.
> 

The moral of the story is: taking AP classes are ok, in fact, they're very good because you never know what you're going to end up doing. I ended up ok, but if I had learned my BC just a bit better, I would be much better off in Calc III and diffy Q much eariler (and subseqently every course that I ended up taking because Calculus is _scarily_ important). 

### Point 3
Do some extracurriculars, that's for sure. Find something that you like; this is __the most important__ part of high school. It doesn't have to be the thing that you end up doing in life, because, odds are, it's not going to be. But __find a goal__. It doesn't have to be as specific as _I want to be create a start up that helps support local croissant businesses_, but something as vague as _I want to get better at playing the saxophone_ is sufficient. This gives you a direction to work towards.
